üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Rik, digital maker/creator

# Vision
My vision is creating and improving digital- products, art, games (you name it as long as it is digital), that help people florish in the things they want to accomplish in work, education, in life.

# Interests
I have a very diverse interest in technology. I like al things Webüï∏Ô∏è related, the good and the bad stuff. Both need to exist in order to balance each other out, its that yin and yang ‚òØÔ∏è feeling.
As you can see I am an avid user of emoticons. This because I think symbols can really emphasize the way you read a text. 

However getting a little bit of topic, as some who know me will probably happen sometimes since I like to wander. 

Currently I am personally interessted in all things automation related. This can be home automation but also task automation. All with my main [vision](# Vision) in the back of my head.  
Also I am interested in creating games with open source tools, like godot and blender. Creating an interactive experience is very cool üòé. 

Still like the AR and VR side of things but more in a sence of how can it add value to communicating the message that needs to be told. 

Also looking into how to combine the whole lot and create physical interfaces for people to use and. 

As you can see my interests are very broad, but all come back to my main [vision](#Vision).

# Learning
Currently I'me spending most of my time learning Python by doing. Small projects that are fun and teach me how to get better in python. 
Main resources for inspiration are the docs of python as well as some creators; Al Sweigart, Arjan Codes and the Python programmer. 

Also want to get inspired see the following: [The Untold Story of Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsYIdMmI5-Q)

Also looking into Svelte to create interessting webapps. Would like to combine the two since I think it is a match made in heaven.
